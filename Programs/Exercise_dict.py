# Itâ€™s...not really an adventure game...#Ver 1.0
# Your village is being attacked by 'a germanic tribe' and you need to run to the 
# stores and get the right things to save your village, and probably some good looking 
# girl or boy you want to marry. All prices in gold pieces excl.
# VAT... chop chop!! ze germanz are coming!
# The code should allow you to get 1 thing from each store and each item you get should
# be removed from the store inventory, then do same for next store...
# one way to buy by typing the key 'newt' in an input box...or something
# at end you should print the 'items' you have taken..in this version you don't have 
# to pay for stuff or add it up

# ver 1.2 add ability to exit a store without buying and go to next by typing 'exit', 
# and to exit if a nonexistant item is bought(typed)
# Add purse with 1000 gold pieces and payment for the items during or at end of code and 
# show a message about total cost and how much gold you have left

# ver 1.4 random bug fix, ' browser compatability', refactoring code... basically being lazy
# ..stop scrolling TikTok/Facebook! ;-)

# Ver 1.5 print inventory before and after purchases as one department_store of stuff
# (combine inventories from all stores into one...pretend Big Biz bought all the local stores,
# and want constant reporting for inventory management...)
# as in all games there is a special way to do this that actually makes money and solves the 
# problem...can you find 'them'? Do you know why? May require knowledge of actual python 'lore'
